# Implementation Plan

## How to use this file

Use this file as a todolist with context.
This section has the task list.
Tasks that need to be worked on should be in "Next Tasks".
Move the task to "In Progress" when starting working on it.
Move the task to the end of "Completed" when finished with a timestamp like "(finished YY-MM-DD HH:mm)".

- [x] Bind UHID device to active sessions via uaccess in tpm-fido2.rules.
- [x] Remove dead Unix-socket IPC control surface (ipc.rs) — unused since GTK frontend removal (2026-07-14).

## General things to keep in mind.
- Commit the changes to git after a task
- Do these tests
    - cargo check
    - cargo test
    - nixos test
    - nix fmt
- Fixup cargo clippy after a POC implementation
- When writing bash scripts for nix, generally keep the script in a separate file and use lib.readFile to import it.
- Create a todolist with the todowrite tool for each task to keep track of progress. The last task should be "Start next task in plan.md" which should update the todolist with the next task.
- Update README and AGENTS.md when a new feature gets implemented or the implementation changed from the original docs.
- Use bullet points on tha plan.md to reduce git diff.
- The user may add tasks in the list.
- When switching to a new task put the task under "## In Progress" in the plan.md file.
- When the current task is moderately large split them up into subtasks and prepenthem in the "Next Tasks" Section
- The "Next Tasks" section should not have any items that are done. If there are, check if they are actually done and if so, move them to Completed.
- Use subagents and delegate tasks when possible.


## Security model design

The [security model](../docs/security.md#current-implementation-status) lists nine issues that must be resolved before production security claims are made.

- [x] Remove approval-reuse grace period in CTAP2 assertions.
- [x] Switch passphrase hashing from SHA-256 to an offline-resistant KDF (PBKDF2/argon2).
- [x] Set a non-empty TPM auth value on PCR-bound credential keys to prevent empty-auth bypass.
- [x] Obtain session identity dynamically from `systemd-logind` instead of environment variables.
- [x] Bind UHID device generations to active sessions with `uaccess` (udev rule already matches with `TAG+="uaccess"`).
- [x] Verify session identity before and after approval interaction.
- [x] Add integrity protection (HMAC/AEAD) for stored credential metadata.
- [x] Document rollback behavior and mitigations.
- [x] Integrate polkit authorization calls into the daemon at runtime.


## Architecture Direction

- `hid` owns the UHID report descriptor and virtual HID identity.
- `ctaphid` owns HID packet framing, channel allocation, request assembly, and CTAPHID responses.
- `ctap2` owns CBOR command parsing, authenticator data, credential lookup, and assertion response shape.
- `store` owns the development SQLite credential schema and migrations and will evolve toward production metadata.
- `tpm` owns key creation/loading, signing, PCR policy sessions, recovery wrapping, and TPM capability checks.

## Non-Goals For Now

- No browser extension.
- No GTK frontedn use polkit.
- No claim of FIDO certification compatibility until the protocol is much more complete.
- No production security claims for the development credential store.
