# Credential Storage

This document describes the current credential storage model and the intended future direction.

## Current Implementation

### Scope

The current implementation stores only CTAP2/WebAuthn credentials backed by TPM-created P-256 ECDSA keys.

U2F/CTAP1 support has been removed.

Software credential support has been removed.

### Store Location

Credentials are stored in a project-local directory by default:

```text
.linux-tpm-fido2-store/
```

The store directory can be overridden at runtime:

```sh
linux-tpm-fido2 --store-dir /path/to/store
```

Startup logs the resolved SQLite database path.

### Files

The current implementation uses one SQLite database:

```text
.linux-tpm-fido2-store/credentials.sqlite
```

The schema is managed with `sqlx` migrations in `migrations/`.

The store directory is git-ignored.

### Schema

The initial migration creates two tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE credentials (
    credential_id BLOB PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    rp_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_handle BLOB NOT NULL,
    user_name TEXT,
    user_display_name TEXT,
    sign_count INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (sign_count >= 0),
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE tpm_keys (
    credential_id BLOB PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL REFERENCES credentials(credential_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    tpm_private BLOB NOT NULL,
    tpm_public BLOB NOT NULL,
    public_key_x BLOB NOT NULL,
    public_key_y BLOB NOT NULL
);
```

`credentials` stores WebAuthn-facing metadata and the signature counter.

`tpm_keys` stores the TPM private/public blobs plus the P-256 public coordinates used for the WebAuthn COSE key.

### CTAP2 TPM Credentials

Behavior:

- During registration, the daemon creates a TPM P-256 ECDSA signing key.
- The TPM returns private/public blobs for the credential key.
- `tpm_private` and `tpm_public` are saved so the key can be loaded later.
- `public_key_x` and `public_key_y` are saved for WebAuthn COSE public key material.
- During assertion, the daemon creates a transient storage parent, loads the credential key blobs, signs the assertion digest in the TPM, then flushes transient TPM handles.
- `sign_count` is incremented after assertion signing and persisted back to SQLite.

Current TPM parent strategy:

- The daemon uses a transient owner-hierarchy storage parent.
- The parent is recreated as needed.
- Child credential blobs are loadable under that parent template.

Current failure behavior:

- If TPM is unavailable, new CTAP2 credential creation fails.
- If a stored TPM credential cannot be loaded or signed, assertion fails.
- There is no software fallback.

Security status:

- TPM private blobs are not raw private keys, but this is still development storage.
- There is no PCR policy yet.
- There is no recovery design yet.
- Metadata is not authenticated as a complete structure yet.

## Current Limitations

- SQLite gives atomic transactions, but the credential schema is still development-oriented.
- Assertion currently increments the in-memory signature counter before signing and then saves; persistence failure semantics still need tightening.
- TPM-backed credentials are not PCR-bound yet.
- TPM-backed credentials do not yet have passphrase recovery slots.
- There is no per-user namespace design yet.
- There is no integrity protection over credential metadata as a whole.

## Future Improvements

### Production Metadata Format

Credential storage should evolve toward a LUKS2-inspired SQLite schema:

- Schema migrations for all persistent changes.
- Atomic updates for registration, counter changes, policy changes, and recovery-slot changes.
- Metadata checksums or authenticated digests where useful.
- Clear separation between credential metadata, encrypted secrets, keyslots, tokens, and policy descriptors.

### TPM-Backed Credentials

Future TPM-backed credential records should include:

- TPM public/private blobs.
- Parent key template or parent key identifier.
- Algorithm identifiers.
- Credential creation policy.
- PCR policy description.
- Recovery policy description.
- RP/user metadata.
- Signature counter state.

The daemon should not store raw software private keys for production credentials.

### PCR Binding

The first production TPM policy target should be secure-boot-state binding.

Future records should describe:

- Hash algorithm.
- PCR selection.
- Expected PCR policy digest.
- Whether the credential is boot-state-bound.
- Whether the credential has a recovery path.

### Recovery

Recovery should use passphrase-unlocked material that remains TPM-bound but is not PCR-bound.

Future recovery metadata should include:

- Keyslot descriptors.
- KDF parameters.
- TPM-wrapped recovery material.
- Recovery token metadata.
- Rotation and revocation support.

### Counters And Durability

Signature counters should be updated safely.

Future improvements should include:

- Atomic counter writes.
- Clear behavior for failed writes after successful signing.
- Possibly monotonic TPM NV counters or another anti-rollback strategy if needed.

### User Namespaces

The storage model must be tied to the daemon/user-session design.

Open options:

- Per-user daemon with per-user credential store.
- System daemon plus per-user helper.
- System daemon routing requests to the active graphical session.

The production design should avoid accidentally sharing one credential namespace across all local users.
